# github_repo

github repo app

## Notes

- filtration is used with search results only because it's not working on repositories api.
- there is debounce time 1.5 seconds in search field to get results.
- instead of navigating to branches screen, I used bottom sheet for UX best practices.
- use refresh indicator to get latest results (apps only, web browsers has reload button).
